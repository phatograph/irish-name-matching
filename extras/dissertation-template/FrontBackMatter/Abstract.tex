\chapter*{Abstract}

Before the first Irish civil registration on 1864, census materials
were mostly lost or incomplete. So genealogical researches use
parish records and also some `census substitute' documents,
such as land ownership and tenancy records. However, some of these documents
do not contain enough information in identify individuals.
Some of them contains name and address, whereas others might contain only name.

\emph{Record linkage} is one method to gather scattered information among many documents.
It uses a person\textquotesingle s name as a reference to link that
person\textquotesingle s information between many documents. With patience,
a more complete information about that person can be obtained.

Apparently linking or matching person\textquotesingle s name is important in the process.
Unfortunately, in the 19\textsuperscript{th} century, in Ireland, there was no standard
of the spelling of names, handwriting could be difficult to read
and contractions or abbreviations were often used. The names with the same
pronunciation and for the same individual could be written in many different ways.
Moreover, Irish names which equivalent to modern names
were used, for example, Irish version of `Smith' could be `Gowan'.

To handle these name variations, various solutions have been created to find
matching different names that refer to the same person. However,
for our extent knowledge, there is yet no public system which encodes
those solutions together and provides a service of name matching.
This project is to create one system to achieve this.

We developed a web service system using Ruby on Rails framework
to achieve our goal. The system is initially encoded with 4 matching algorithms,
Levenshtein distance, soundex, Irish soundex, and lookup table.
We also present a web interface for a client to use the system
from the web browser. It is designed to be simple and extensible from using
inheritance.
