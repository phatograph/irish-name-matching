\chapter*{Acknowledgements} % Acknowledgements section text

First of all, I would like to express my utmost gratitude to my supervisor,
Dr Adam Winstanley, for initiating this project and always advise
and suggest me. It is my pleasure to have a chance to work on
a web service project, which is one of my favourite field of work.
Thank you very much.

To my dear mom and dad and my family who always understand and support me.

To all my dear friends and St. Pauls family, thanks a million for
helping me in many ways, it could have been very tough without you guys.

To Patomporn Loungvara who always helps me survive my study,
years after years.

Many thanks to Andre Miede for a perfect \LaTeX \xspace thesis template,
it makes my life much more easier. Also thanks to Randall Munroe of xkcd
for inspirations of many figures in this work, and the
IPython\footnote{https://github.com/ipython} team for a lovely
xkcd font.

And to Lulu who puts my mind at ease and encourages me on my work.
It is much more fun and relax working by your side.
