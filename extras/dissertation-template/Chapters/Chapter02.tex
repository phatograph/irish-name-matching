From research questions on section \ref{sec:rq}, there are three aforementioned
terms that will be a \emph{core} research fields of this project.
These fields are \emph{name matching}, \emph{web service},
and \emph{extensible platform}.

\subsection{Soundex}

% This project relies on matching names of individuals from documents
% created in the early 19th century, a time when spelling was not standardized,
% handwriting could be difficult to read, contractions were used
% and many people were illiterate and so dictated their names to
% whoever was writing them down. This is a common problem in genealogy
% and various solutions have been found.

% ‘Traditional Soundex’
% is a way of encoding a name for indexing, searching and matching
% that translates the name into a 4 character code that tries
% to characterise the essence of its sound in speech.
% The motivation is that similar sounding names, spelled differently,
% will produce the same code and so can be found when searching
% for the name in indexes. Soundex coding works on the assumption
% that consonant sounds remain more immutable in speech than vowels
% and that the first letter of a name rarely is mistaken.
% Therefore, the code consists of the first letter of the name
% followed by three digits encoding the first three consonant sounds
% in the name in the range 1..6, the letters being grouped
% into generally similar sounding categories (for example,
% both ‘m’ and ‘n’ share the code ‘5’). The codes for long names
% are truncated while short names are padded out with zeroes
% so all Soundex codes are 4 characters long. This makes for
% efficient searching for names in computer systems,
% results being based on an approximation of the sound of a name
% and so returning matches that traditional alphabetical searches
% would ignore.

% However, the Soundex algorithm can encode
% quite different names the same (for example McDonald and McAdam)
% and so produce spurious results. It also relies on the immutability
% of the first letter, so eliminating possible identically sounding names
% (for example Kane and Caine). Other techniques have been used
% to overcome these disadvantages as well as the western assumptions
% behind Soundex. These include Fuzzy Matching based on the Levenshtein distance
% formula, the Daitch-Mokotoff Soundex System (for Yiddish)
% and Beider-Morse Phonetic Matching (BMPM).

% Irish surnames are a mixture of various influences reflecting
% the country’s history. In 1841, the majority used on official documents
% were either Anglicisations or translations of original Celtic names,
% using various spellings. Matheson, the assistant registrar-general in Dublin,
% used the civil registers in 1894 to produce a survey of names
% classified by original language, distribution and frequency.
% In 1901, he developed this into a full classification system with
% the aim of helping in searches of the register indexes.
% He illustrates it with examples collected from registry offices,
% where many of members of close families used different forms of their surnames
% (for example, a man called Smith registered as dead by his son using
% the name O’Gowan). He used this information to classify the surnames of Ireland
% into 2091 groups of alternate forms of the same name. For example,
% group 1897 consists of Smith, Smyth, Smythe, Smeeth, Gowan, O’Gowan,
% MacGowan, McGowan, M’Gowan, Goan, Going, Gow, Magough.
% However, his classification is far from complete and also includes
% multiple mapping between names (that is, the same name can occur
% in more than one group).
%
% More recent specifically Irish surname matching systems have been developed
% by the Irish Family History Foundation for searches on their RootsIreland website.
% This uses a Standard Surname search based on very extensive groupings
% which seems to have been compiled and added to as the records were digitised.
% They also provide a list of first-names and their variants.
